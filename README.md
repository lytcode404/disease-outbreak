# Disease Outbreak Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains code and documentation for predicting disease outbreaks using machine learning techniques. By leveraging historical data, environmental factors, and socio-economic indicators, the project aims to develop predictive models to identify the likelihood and intensity of disease outbreaks in specific regions.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, normalize data, and engineer features relevant to disease outbreaks.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize trends, correlations, and spatial distributions.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implement various models including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks, and more.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
- **Prediction Visualization**: Display predictions on maps and charts for intuitive understanding.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up the project and run the models on your system.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/disease-outbreak-prediction.git
   cd disease-outbreak-prediction
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate   # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset by placing it in the `data/` directory. Ensure it matches the expected format.
2. Run the preprocessing script:

   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
